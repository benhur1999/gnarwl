.SH SYNOPSIS
.B damnit 
[\-h] 
[\-d\ <file>\ <value>]
[\-a\ <file>\ <value>] 
[\-f\ <string>]
[\-l\ <file>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B damnit
is the database management tool for 
.B gnarwl(_MANSEC_)
\&. It allows
systemadministrators to list and/or manipulate 
.B gnarwl's
database files. It is 
not intented to be employed by the average user, who should use LDAP as
the only interface to
.B gnarwl(_MANSEC_)
.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -h
Print usage information

.IP "-f <string>"
Select output format for database listing (only meaningful with -l).
<string> is the template for what the output should look like. The following
macros are recognized: %entry, %time, %tstamp, \\en and \\et. Translating to
the entry itself, the entrytime (in human readable form), the entrytime (as
timestamp), a newline character, and a tab character.
The default format is: "%time -> %entry\\en". Don't forget the trailing 
newline.

.IP "-d <file> [<value>]"
Delete <value> from <file>. If <value> is omited, damnit will read <value>
from stdin (one per line), until either EOF or an empty line is detected.

.IP "-a <file> [<value>]"
Add <value> to <file>. If <value> is already stored in <file>, damnit will
only update the timestamp. If <value> is omited, damnit will read <value>
from stdin (one per line), until either EOF or an emtpy line is detected.

.IP "-l <file>"
List database file specified by <file>.

.SH DATABASE FILES
.B gnarwl
uses hashfiles for storing information on disk. Meaning, all
datasets consist of key and value pairs. The key is always 
a NULL terminated character string, while the value contains the timestamp,
when the key was entered (last time) into the file. This timestamp is of type
time_t (as returned by time(2)) and therefore, 
.B gnarwl's
database files are not copyable between different system architectures.

the timeout specified in gnarwl.cfg expires.
